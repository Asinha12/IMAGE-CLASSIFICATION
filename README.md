# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
This is an Image Classification project, in python code, using TensorFlow.
Data Description
The Sorghum-100 dataset consists of 48,106 images and 100 different sorghum cultivars. This dataset is from Kaggle Competitions and categorised under Fine Grained Visual Categorisation. The Sorghum-100 dataset is a curated subset of the RGB imagery captured during the TERRA-REF experiments, labeled by cultivar. This data could be used to develop and assess a variety of plant phenotyping models which seek to answer questions relating to the presence or absence of desirable traits. 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
A detailed exploratory data analysis is done, which studies teh train images and test images and the different classes of crops. The test data is expected to have a slightly different distribution


## Training and Testing
The notebook includes training and testing with pre-training models, using Tensorflow.
